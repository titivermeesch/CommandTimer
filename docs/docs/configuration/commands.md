# Commands

## Execution Modes

Execution modes are set on the entire [task](../jargon#task) and not on individual commands

- `ALL`: Execute all the commands at the same time
- `ORDERED`: Execute the commands one by one. This is directly linked to the [interval](schedules.md#intervals) set for
  this task. If you interval is set to 10 seconds for example and you have 3 commands configured, it will run the 1
  command, wait 10 seconds, then execute the second command, wait 10 seconds, then execute the third command, wait 10
  seconds, and execute the first one again.
- `RANDOM`: Execute a random command for each execution
- `INTERVAL`: This one is very similar to `ORDERED` but has a seconds parameter configurable in the menu directly. This
  seconds parameter is not linked to the general [task](../jargon#task) [interval](schedules.md). Updating this value in
  the GUI can be achieved by right clicking on the execution mode item.

## Command Settings

- Reset last executed command index: This option allows you to start the command execution from the beginning. This only
  applies for execution modes `ORDERED` and `INTERVAL` which keep track of which command has already been executed
  before.

## Genders

Genders define for whom the command will be executed.

- `CONSOLE`: The command will be executed once in the console. There is no user data available here. If that is what you
  want, have a look at `CONSOLE_PER_USER`.
- `CONSOLE_PER_USER`: Execute the command in the console, but for each player. This means that if you have 20 players
  online, CommandTimer will execute the command 20 times (once for each player). [Placeholders](../placeholders)
  like `%player_name%` are available here (under the condition that PAPI is installed).
- `OPERATOR`: Execute the command for each player as if they were server operators (OP). This will execute the command
  for each player that is online and placeholders like `%player_name%` are available here. For the player perspective,
  it will look like the player executed the command himself.
- `PLAYER`: Execute the command for each player. If this player does not have enough permissions to execute this
  command, the player will receive an error message from the command itself. Placeholders like `%player_name%` are
  available here. If you don't want the player to see a message related to permissions, you should use
  the [conditions engine](conditions.md) to check if the player has the permission before executing it.
- `CONSOLE_PER_USER_OFFLINE`: Same as `CONSOLE_PER_USER` but also executed for all offline players that every joined. *
  *Please note that the conditions engine is currently not compatible with this gender**
- `CONSOLE_PROXY`: Execute commands on your proxy. You need the [CommandTimer Proxy Extension](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/commandtimer-proxy-extension.120439/) for this. Depending on which version of the extension you use the commands may only be executed when a player is connected to the proxy network

## Command iteration interval

For all genders (except `CONSOLE`) an interval can be set. This interval will be
applied on each execution of this specific command. This means that if you use the `PLAYER` gender and set the interval
on 2 seconds, it will execute the command for each player but with a 2 second interval between each player. Do not
confuse this with the normal [interval](schedules.md#intervals), which will still work as usual in combination with
this.

## Individual command delays

When your [task](../jargon#task) is configured with [execution mode](#execution-modes) ORDERED, you can set a delay for
each command. This delay will be added at the end of each command, which means the next command in line will only be
executed once that delay passed.

Let's say you have this:

- Command 1 with a delay of 5 seconds
- Command 2 with a delay of 10 seconds
- Command 3

The first command will be executed according to the configuration of the task. The second command will be executed after
5 seconds and the 3rd command after 15 seconds (it will wait for the second command to execute before counting down).
