## Metrics

Besides the common metrics, CommandTimer also registers the amount of loaded tasks and the amount of executions per
second that are happening on your server. CommandTimer does not save any personal data that may be added in CommandTimer
configuration files.

## Auto updater

CommandTimer will not automatically update, but will show you a message in the chat that a new version can be
downloaded. It is always recommended to update to the latest version.

By default only OP players will view the update messages, but you can also give certain players the
permission `commandtimer.update` to show them the message.
