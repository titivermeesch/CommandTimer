## Can I execute a task on restart only

Yes, by using [execution limits](../configuration/others/#Executionlimits).

1. Set the execution limit to 1
2. Activate the feature "reset execution after restart"
3. Configure your [task](jargon.md#task) as you would do usually

Add `register: true` in your MyCommand config and restart/reload the server
